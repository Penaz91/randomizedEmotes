# randomizedEmotes For Spigot 1.10

randomizedEmotes is a small Spigot plugin that takes a random emote from a
certain category defined in the configuration and gives it out to all the
players in a certain radius. This is great if paired with any CommandItems
plugin.

### Commands

- **/randemote**: Shows the plugin information and the list of emotes available
- **/randemote <name>**: Performs the emote in the <name> category

### Permissions

- **randomEmote.use**: Only permission available to use all the emotes and info
panel

### Default emotes

- **coin**: Flips a coin
- **d20**: Throws a D20, useful for a minecraft session of DnD

##### License and other stuff

I'm fine with commercial usage of this plugin, as well as any kind of modification
to the source code, as long as I'm quoted as the original author of this plugin.
